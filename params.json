I liked the creating of smart-lists and used the service a lot. The iPhone and android apps are (were?) for paying users only. Lucky me! Time to build one. I started with this list viewer.\r\n\r\n### jQuery mobile\r\nI like jQuery a lot. It introduced me to javaScript. jQuery mobile must be good. I used a beta here.\r\n\r\n### Demo or it didn't happen\r\nYou can see a demo of my code in action on [werktie](http://www.werktie.nl/rtm/rtm/)\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nThere is not a lot of code in here. But the code that Ã¬s in here is organised, that's for sure! This code shows my passion for mobile development, the use of cross site content 'scraping' (ok, it's just RSS) and the ability to work in an organised fashion.\r\n\r\nPS: I use and recommend doit.im for task management nowadays","tagline":"Remember the milk in jQuery mobile (beta) handled by Zend Framework"}
